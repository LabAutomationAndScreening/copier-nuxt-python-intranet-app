    """Build an OpenAPI ``responses`` entry documenting a ``ProblemDetails`` error.

    Holds the ~80% that every error response shares (the ``application/problem+json`` media type and the
    ``ProblemDetails`` schema ref) so route decorators only pass what differs: status and description.
    Merge several with dict unpacking: ``{**problem_response(...), **problem_response(...)}``.

    ``example`` is synthesized from ``status_code`` and ``description`` so the docs
    show a body that matches this response (e.g. a 400 titled "Bad Request") instead of the generic
    field-level example rendered from a bare ``ProblemDetails`` schema ref. Pass ``instance`` to point the
    example at the route's real path.

    When one status code covers several distinct failures, pass ``examples`` instead: each
    :class:`ProblemExample` becomes a named entry, expanded here into a full ``ProblemDetails`` body.
    Expanding them here rather than at the call site is what keeps them valid against the schema they sit
    under — a hand-written ``{"detail": ...}`` omits the required ``title``, ``status`` and ``instance``.
